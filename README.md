# Reel-Films  

The original Reel-films github repository was taken offline. Reel Films was my second group project while attending UCLA Extension. I was the leader of this group as we worked as a team to complete.   

Reel films is a web application that shows movie trailers based on the a users pre-selected criteria. We sort the movie trailers by genre, rating, year released and much more to tailor a custom trailer watching experience to the end user. We utilized HMTL, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax API requests. We utilized 3 separate API’s including Youtube’s API, OMBD and The Movie DB. Click on the thumbnail to see the project which is hosted on github pages.
